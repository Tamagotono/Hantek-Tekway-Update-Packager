This is a script that is heavily modified from one posted by "siblynx" on github
https://github.com/siblynx/dso5102p_better_dumper/upload/master

use the template folder to make the scripts to run on the scope and then run this script to package it all up into an ".up" update file.
You can edit the static variables in the head of the file to customize the filename.



TODO:
Add commandline options to override the static variables.
